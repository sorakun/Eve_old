This file is about is safety compared to C programming language

Eve allows low level access to memory, but in a high level layer.

Variables' pointers in Eve can not defined directly (ex: "int ^ p"). 
The user should create a pointer type (ex:"type pint is ^ int;") and 
then defines his variables with that data type.

Memory allocation is optional, Because Eve already extends arrays, 
while associating values to them.
