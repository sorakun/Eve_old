Fixes:
------
  
  - Pointers are now Implemented, still the way to read their value with "^" operator.
  - Fixed unary problem with substract, because this operation is partially unary (not always).
  - Few optimization to parser, for small inputs it do not have big impact. The effect appears in massive inputs.
  - Command line arguments partially working.
  - Added import statement, but still not fully implemented.
  - Loops: for, while, repeat .. until.
  - if, elif, else statements.
  - substract work in unary and binary modes.
  - local variables supported.
  - Comments are working.
  - multiple variable defenition and assignment is working "int x = 3, y = 2;".
  - Return implemented.
  - Break and continue are implemented.
  - Boolean data types supported.
  - Operators "==", "!=", "=", "<", ">", "<=", ">=", "and", "or", "xor" and "not" are working perfectly, with multityped  feature.
  - Recursivity supported.
  - Seperated defenitions and declarations not supported. 
  - Fixed error while assigning a variable (error of type checking).
  - Fixed an error of segmentation fault while looking for a variable defenition in code generation.
  - Ability to add a C file, or a static library using "cimport" keyword.
  - String concat with "+" operator.
  
-----------  
Non fixses:
-----------

  - Defining simple data types is buggy (ex: "type x is int").  
  - Operations priorities is not stable.
  - Operations types and their operands is not stable.
  - Exceptions not implemented yet try .. catch .. throw.
  - Creation of data types and complex data types is not possible (enums, arrays, records, ranges, etc).
  - Instructions in the global thread are nor reported, but they are not generated.
  - The following operations are nor working: "++", "--", "+=", "-=", "*=", "/=", "<<", ">>", "%=" "<<=" and ">>="
  - Switch statement not implemented.
  - foreach loop statement not implemented (require array/range data types which are not impletemented yet). 
  - Step is not implemented in for loop statement (likely to be replaced by C like loop statement).
  - with .. do statement not supported (thinking about dropping it).
  
------------------------
Non critic but required:
------------------------

  - Parser optimization.
  - Compiler flags.
  
------------------
Upcoming features:
------------------

  - Object oriented programming (purely OPP style).
  - Preprocessor
