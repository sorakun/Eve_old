Welcome to Eve programming language.

Eve is a general purpose high level programming language.
The main purpose is to create a language, that can do 
low level tasks like memory allocation, pointers, etc,
but in a high level and safe layer.

Eve also aims to be more readable and easier to understand,
its syntax is a mix of Caml and Ada, which allow fast typing
and code readability.

Eve features are:

  - Cross platform compiler.
  - Imperative (Procedural) programming.
  - Strong typing.
  - Static typing (safe typing).
  - Dynamic memory allocation (TODO).
  - Allow the integration of C libraries/source code.
