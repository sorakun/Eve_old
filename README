Welcome to Eve programming language.

Eve is a general purpose high level programming language.
The main purpose is to create a language, that can do 
low level tasks like memory allocation, pointers, etc,
but in a higher and safer layer.

Eve also comes with powerful C features and an elegent
syntax which is a mix of Caml and Ada, that allow fast 
typing and code readability.

Eve features are:
  
  - Cross platform compiler.
  - Object Oriented language
  - Imperative (Procedural) programming.
  - Strong typing.
  - Static typing (safe typing).
  - Dynamic memory allocation (TODO).
  - Allow the integration of C libraries/source code.
